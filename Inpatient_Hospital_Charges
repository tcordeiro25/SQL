-- Ctitical Thinking Notes:
-- 1. highlights the regions where medical costs might be higher or lower, indentifiying potential cost drivers.
-- 2. By listing providers with the highest number of total discharges, allows to gain insights into which healthcare facilities handle a large volume of patients. (This might be important for resource allocation and understanding demand.)
-- 3. Identifying DRGs with high average total payments can help focus attention on medical areas that might be more costly to treat.
-- 4. Comparing average total payments to average Medicare payments can reveal whether Medicare payments align closely with the overall average. This can help identify if private payments differ significantly from Medicare reimbursements.
-- 5. Analyzing average covered charges and total discharges by hospital referral region can highlight geographic variations in healthcare costs and utilization. Able to identify regions with higher or lower average charges and discharges.
-- 6. Analyzing average payments (covered charges, total payments, Medicare payments) by state allows to understand how payment patterns differ across states. This can lead to insights about regional healthcare cost variations and payment sources.
